# Sean's Arcade Game
## FEND game implementation by Sean Krinik

## Getting Started:

This arcade game is very similar to Frogger. If you're unfamiliar with Frogger, no problem, you'll understand how it works in just a second.

To begin, simply run index.html and the game will self initiate.

## Gameplay

You have 10 lives, and there are three levels of difficulty which update as you level up. The speed at which the enemies move increases after completing levels 4 and 8. After every other level you complete, another enemy is introduced as well.

Once you lose all your lives, a button will appear, allowing you to restart the game.

## Notes

* If game load takes a while, it is due to the CDN implementation of jQuery.
* In addition to jQuery, Lato font from google fonts is used, link in head tag
* The style.css file was edited just to change the font style

## ENJOY!  (:

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
